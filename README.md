# PacFactory

>https://hunterwarburton.github.io/PacFactory/pacFactory.html


## DESCRIPTION
This project is a demonstration of Creating and controlling objects with HTML and Javascript. PacMen objects are created then added to an array. Starting the movement gives them a random velocity. When they reach the end of the page they change direction.


## HOW TO USE
Press the "Create a PacMan" button to create a new instance of a pacman object.
Press the "Start Movement" button to increase the movement speed.
This project is meant to practice integrating HTML and Javascript


## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
I would like to add functionality where the user can choose the speed the pacmen move at, rather than just increase it with a button. Also causing the pacmen to constantly rotate through their images based on their speed would make it more interesting.
